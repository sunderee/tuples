# tuples

Collection of Kotlin-inspired named tuples (from `Pair` to `Sextuple`). If you need more than 6 elements in a tuple, seek help elsewhere. This package only uses `meta` (static analysis annotations) and `equatable` (override `==` and `hashCode`).

## Usage

Use as a Git dependency in your project (preferably under `dependencies`):

```yaml
dependencies:
    tuples:
        git: https://github.com/sunderee/tuples.git
        ref: master
```
